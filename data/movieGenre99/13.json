[[{"overview":"In 1955, Tobias Schneebaum disappeared into the depths of the Peruvian Amazon. He had no guide, no map, and only the vaguest of instructions: Keep the river on your right. A year later Schneebaum emerged from the jungle\u2026naked, covered in body paint, and a modern-day cannibal.  Titled after Schneebaum\u2019s 1969 cult classic memoir about his formative experiences living in the Amazon, Keep The River On Your Right is the extraordinary stranger-than-fiction story of Schneebaum\u2019s return to the jungle, 45 years after his original visit, to reunite with the very tribesmen he loved and who gave him nightmares for nearly half a century. A deeply affecting and searing portrait, sibling filmmakers Laurie and David Shapiro capture a man in utter conflict, a fearless adventurer, and one of the most charming, enigmatic, and perplexing men ever captured on screen.","original_language":"en","original_title":"Keep the River on Your Right: A Modern Cannibal Tale","video":false,"title":"Keep the River on Your Right: A Modern Cannibal Tale","genre_ids":[99],"poster_path":"\/oHR0KPt0RE74iy3WyGPEmfLPbJM.jpg","backdrop_path":"\/8XwhF6sYO7UFHUGt6KGZSgdJ0ye.jpg","release_date":"2000-04-15","popularity":1.963,"vote_average":6.7,"id":65075,"adult":false,"vote_count":7},{"overview":"GOODNIGHT, WE LOVE YOU is a film that chronicles the final stand-up comedy performance of a true living legend - the first female stand-up comic in history: Phyllis Diller.
