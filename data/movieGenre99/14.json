[[{"overview":"\u201CThe NFL Today\u201D on CBS was one of the preeminent sports programs on television in the early 1980s.

Born in Steubenville, Ohio, to Greek immigrants, Jimmy overcame childhood tragedy, moved to Las Vegas, and eventually became the biggest name in the world of sports handicapping. When CBS added him as an \u201Canalyst\u201D on \u201CThe NFL Today,\u201D \u201CThe Greek\u201D not only further increased his stature as a sort of national folk hero, but he also gained an air of respectability never before associated with gamblers.
