One day he picks up the phone and hears the voice of his father, who was presumed dead. He tells Andrei that the hunt is open for him. He is trying to destroy unknown forces, and he can only run. Andrei is now driven by a desire not only to survive, but also to find his father again. To help the protagonist comes his first love, Masha, who in everything that happens also has her own interest.
