CBS mounted a new production in 1965, with Richard Rodgers as Executive Producer and written by Joseph Schrank.  The new script hewed closer to the traditional tale, although nearly all of the original songs were retained and sung in their original settings. Added to the Rogers and Hammerstein score was \"Loneliness of Evening\", which had been composed for South Pacific in 1949 but not used in that musical.  The 1965 debut had a Nielsen rating of 42.3, making it the highest-rated non-sports special on CBS from the beginning of the Nielsen ratings until 2009, and the 50th highest-rated show of any kind during that period.",

Ben can't stand Jill's impossibly perfect new boyfriend, and the prospect of spending the entire evening with his former inlaws is nearly too painful to ponder. But this Christmas things are going to be different, because this Christmas might just last forever. At first Kevin resists the curious development by simply reverting to his childish ways, though he is about to find out that sometimes in order to build a better future one must finally make amends with the past. ~ Jason Buchanan",
