On March 24, 1944, in the heart of Nazi controlled territory, 76 British, Canadian, Norwegian and French pilots who were held in Stalag Luft III, a prison camp of the Luftwaffe, escaped. The tunnel used for their flight was constructed in the greatest secrecy, under the nose of the German jailers. In fact, the POWs had dug three tunnels, nicknamed Tom, Dick and Harry, some 30 feet deep and extending 300 feet into the woods outside the camp. Stalag Luft III was created in Sagan - today Żagań, in Poland - in 1942. The camp was said to be impossible to escape. Unique testimony from the last survivors, recreations, and today's digital images bring this riveting tale to viewers.

He spent his life in pursuit of the ideal of beauty, an ideal that found expression in three of the most extraordinary, ornate architectural schemes imaginable - the castle of Neuschwanstein and the palaces of Linderhof and Herrenchiemsee. Today, these three buildings are among Germany's biggest tourist attractions.
