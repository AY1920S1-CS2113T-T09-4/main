When the signal from one of the transmitters suddenly disappears, a team of soldiers led by Major Elbert Stevens (Bottoms) and cave specialists led by Rupert 'Wolf' Wolfsen (Powell) including scientist Leslie Peterson (Blount) are sent in to find out what happened.  Exploring deep underground, they stumble upon a tribe of albino cave-dwellers who have apparently been isolated from the rest of the world for thousands of years. The cave-dwellers are hurt by radio frequencies and are able to see in infra-red frequencies, tracking the explorers by their body heat.","original_language":"en","original_title":"What Waits Below","video":false,"title":"What Waits Below","genre_ids":[27,12,878],"poster_path":"\/iVR7qyuKL0mPnIBxQqe8uUeu05U.jpg","backdrop_path":"\/6g7E5sf7p5DgfE1e9RJjyRNAv2F.jpg","release_date":"1984-11-19","popularity":2.016,"vote_average":3.8,"id":28867,"adult":false,"vote_count":6},{"overview":"A 14 year old boy named Gunther moves to a small town with his parents and little brother. He meets up with a group of overly charitable paper boys who want him to sub for their friend while he's out of town.

As this plan has failed, Pokrovsky assisted by some terrorists organizes a hostage taking in a Moscow circus (very similar to Moscow theater hostage crisis in real life) in order to return to Russia, acting as a saver of the hostages during negotiations. However, he fails to do so. The movie also depicts the Pankisi Gorge in Georgia as a place where an important Islamic militant hides, which was a common allegation by Russian authorities in real life around that time, and depicts destruction of a base of terrorists and allies of Pokrovsky in Qatar which might hint at the assassination of Zelimkhan Yandarbiev. Overall, the movie was widely considered propaganda.","original_language":"ru","original_title":"Личный номер","video":false,"title":"Countdown","genre_ids":[28,12,80],"poster_path":"\/tEX7kUa6s1ymsvPpXMRNtqyfEYU.jpg","backdrop_path":"\/nDahpzw3b2m7QTNglhtPHuh5EL7.jpg","release_date":"2004-12-12","popularity":2.069,"vote_average":6,"id":60236,"adult":false,"vote_count":7},{"overview":"Spy School is the story of a twelve year old boy known for telling tall tales who overhears a plot to kidnap the President's daughter.
