[[{"overview":"This story first takes you to Misslimeri, a little Sicilian village, and into the home of Don Ruggero, a wealthy landowner. Don Ruggero is an iron-hearted man and strongly prejudiced against the lower classes. His son, Corrado, a young fellow, loves Rosalia, a shepherdess, but Don Ruggero has always refused to allow their marriage and to recognize little Vincenzino, their child, as his grandchild. Finally to destroy all Corrado's hopes, he discharges poor Rosalia from his farm, where she had been employed for many years. Even the sight of her departure with Vincenzino in her arms does not soften him. Rosalia is the very ideal of the Sicilian beauty, and Capt. Altieri, an officer in the service of the Dominators, the Bourbons, admires her immensely, but all his approaches are strongly repulsed by her. Don Ruggero and his son have for a long time conspired to free their motherland from the hands of the Bourbons, and when they receive news of the arrival of Garibaldi.","original_language":"it","original_title":"I mille","video":false,"title":"A Sicilian Heroine","genre_ids":[36],"poster_path":"\/nhxdGzi3lBNNrfP0BxJ5OT929JU.jpg","backdrop_path":null,"release_date":"1912-12-28","popularity":0.6,"vote_average":0,"id":88739,"adult":false,"vote_count":0},{"overview":"A one-of-a-kind compilation offering a fascinating, entertaining, and surprising look at the Fab Four with rare newsreel footage, candid and revealing interviews, and historic performances.
