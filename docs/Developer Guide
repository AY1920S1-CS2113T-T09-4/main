# Developer Guide

Our Javafx app is primarily targeted at people who have huge love and interest for movies and TV shows.
Our app hence aims to provide a fast and efficient way to find and/or do movies and TV shows related stuff such as getting ratings and reviews for a particular movie and/or TV shows and etc.
The app is also intended for people who prefer desktop apps over other types, have the ability to type fast and  prefer typing over other means of input.
As such, the app will have a GUI (Graphical User Interface) but most of the user interactions will happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

2) Value proposition:
Users will be able to save time and effort doing movies and/or TV show related stuff compared to a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
Furthermore, our app intends to provide various entertainment related functionalities all under one roof so that users will not have the need to install different entertainment related apps for different purposes.
