By: `CS2113T T09-04`      Since: `Sep 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `11`* or above
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `main` and try a few commands
. <<Testing#,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SGTravel branding and refer to the `AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-4/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-4/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Documentation#Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about <<DeveloperGuide#Design-Architecture, Entertainment-Pro's architecture>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architechture_Diagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of Entertainment-Pro. Entertainment-Pro adopts a n-tier style architecture where higher layers make use of services provided by lower layers. Here is a quick overview of each layer/component:

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The user interface of the application
* <<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>>: A collection of classes used by multiple other components
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The main controller of the entire application
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the application in-memory
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

This collection includes every class that is directly associated with the user interface of the application. All Ui controller classes are part of this collection.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these `UI` parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/entertainment-pro/ui/MovieHandler.java[`Main`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainPage.fxml[`MainPage.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Recives commannd results from `Logic` component so that the `UI` can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common component

Commons represent a collection of classes common to many other classes. This package includes all enumerations declared in the scope of the project, exceptions, as well as String prompt messages and constants that are used throughout the project. 

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

This collection includes every logical class that deals with the logical processing of information and data. Classes that deal with the command parsing, command execution, autocompletion and prediction as well as API requests come under this collection. 


[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The Model collection defines the class templates for all custom objects created to encapsulate data. 

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
The storage collection contains classes which deal with the storage of the application data both in-memory and hard disk. It also contains storage utility classes which deal with the writing and reading of data to and from the hard disk.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Command Parser

.UML diagram of how user input is handled
image::Command_Parser_UML.png[width="800" align="left"]

The command parser functionality enables the user commands to be processed effectively. Its implementation also allows for greater flexibility for developers to be able to introduce new commands to the program without having to deal with the underlying implementation of the command parser itself. This is made possible by giving each root command a class of its own. They inherit the CommandSuper class which contains member variables and functions that can be used to conveniently get the details (see section 1.1) from the user input. There is also an abstract function that needs to be implemented in the child classes. This function is named the executeCommand() , which defines the logic that needs to be implemented for each subroot command that is associated with the particular root command.




*Target user profile*:

* Our Javafx app is primarily targeted at people who have huge love and interest for movies and TV shows.
* Our app hence aims to provide a fast and efficient way to find and/or do movies and TV shows related stuff such as getting ratings and reviews for a particular movie and/or TV shows and etc.
* The app is also intended for people who prefer desktop apps over other types, have the ability to type fast and  prefer typing over other means of input.
* As such, the app will have a GUI (Graphical User Interface) but most of the user interactions will happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).


*Value proposition*:

* Users will be able to save time and effort doing movies and/or TV show related stuff compared to a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
* Furthermore, our app intends to provide various entertainment related functionalities all under one roof so that users will not have the need to install different entertainment related apps for different purposes.
