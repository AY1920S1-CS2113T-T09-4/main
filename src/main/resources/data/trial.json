As Enzo persuades a reluctant Jacques to compete against him in a free diving contest -- determining who can dive deeper and longer without scuba gear -- Jacques meets Johana, a beautiful insurance investigator from America, and he finds that he must choose between his love for her and his love of the sea.",      "release_date": "1988-05-11",      "vote_average": 7.6,      "runtime": 168,      "cert": "15",      "id": 175,      "title": "The Big Blue",      "adult": false    },    {      "genres_id": [        27,        9648,        80      ],      "cast": [        "Leigh Whannell",        "Cary Elwes",        "Danny Glover",        "Ken Leung",        "Dina Meyer"      ],      "overview": "Obsessed with teaching his victims the value of life, a deranged, sadistic serial killer abducts the morally wayward.
